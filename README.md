# Corona-Virus-Newsletter
This is a program which will parse the latest data (total cases, death count etc) from worldometers.info/coronavirus (Worldometer) 
and send it through email. Besides, it will provide the latest corona update from my country and automatically give email updates. 

Look carefully, there are a method in this file named "server.login()".
The parameter of this method is (gmail user name, gmail password). 
Please replace it with your email and password and make it safe from others. 
This program won't email and throw and error if you don't put the right email information.I kept those 2 lines hidden for privacy purpose. 

This was my very beginner python project. I had not intention to use these data illegally. 
These are just for educational purpose. 

Thank you
